🎉 I successfully defended my PhD thesis, [“Regularization Techniques for Low-Resource Machine Translation”](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/publication/82a4a497-7d4f-4075-9c4c-487f4d54be03)! Grateful for the guidance, support, and years of learning at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) and [HEIG-VD](https://heig-vd.ch/), and particularly my supervisor [Andrei Popescu-Belis](https://iict-space.heig-vd.ch/apu/)!
